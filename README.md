# Find Project

Rust version of a `find_project` script that can quickly switch between projects
using `fzf` and `tmux`.

## Runtime Dependencies
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A command-line fuzzy finder 
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): A terminal multiplexer

## Future Goals
- [ ] Replace the use of `std::process::Command` with bindings.
- [ ] Write my own fuzzy finder.
